							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the steps involved in choosing good typography for a design involves identifying purpose, audience,

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about all the different principles and considerations that go into something that often goes unobserved. Seeing the 
								principles come together seamlessly in the typography style guide at the bottom is really cool! I also found it really interesting that there is a metric for what is considered
								the golden ratio for font size! </p>
