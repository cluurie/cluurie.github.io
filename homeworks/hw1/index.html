        <li>I learned from the article 4 different design considerations that go into a website,
            which include hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. When looking at a website, it's easy to observe everything
            as a cohesive unit, but it is important to isolate components on a page to develop an eye for design. The tone and writing of a
            page is also very important when establishing a pages' experience and vibe, which is also an element of design. </li>
        <li>My favorite part of the article are the interactive examples of Spotify, Twitter, and Airbnb. The 
            gifs really help to demonstrate the mindset we should have when looking at interfaces to isolate design components.
