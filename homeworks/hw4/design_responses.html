							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The article talks about how important it is to make sure everyone can use products, especially those with visual impairments. It gives tips for designers to make their products more accessible, like using enough contrast in colors and providing different design options for people who have trouble seeing certain colors. By focusing on color accessibility, designers can make sure their products work well for everyone, which is awesome for a wider range of users. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was learning about the regulatory requirements around accessibility because it is something that I did not know existed!
								It was interesting to learn the prevalence of federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites. Starting off this article with this interesting fact really drew 
								my attention, as learning about federal regulations was not what I expected out of a design article, but it showcases the importance of accessibility. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
