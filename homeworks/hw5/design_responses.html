                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> One thing I learned from this article is the importance of smooth transitions and animations in UI design. Seeing how subtle motion can significantly enhance the user experience was eye-opening. It made me realize that even small details like transitions between different states or elements can have a big impact on how users perceive and interact with a digital interface.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part of the article was the diverse range of UI interactions showcased, each offering unique and innovative approaches to enhancing user experience. The inclusion of animated GIFs allowed for a quick and clear understanding of how each interaction worked in action. Additionally, the article provided insightful commentary on the design principles behind each interaction, making it a valuable resource for designers seeking inspiration and learning opportunities.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Among the UI interactions showcased in the article, my favorite was the "Card Switch Animation" by Jardson Almeida. This interaction stood out to me because of its seamless transition between different content cards, creating a visually appealing and engaging experience for users. The interface achieved its goal by effectively conveying information through smooth animations and clear visual cues, enhancing user understanding and interaction. Additionally, the use of subtle motion and well-designed transitions added a delightful touch, making the browsing experience more enjoyable and memorable for users. </p>
